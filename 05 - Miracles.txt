Matthew 14:18, Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand:

"We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,[1]" they answered.

"Bring them here to me," he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. 
Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke 
the loaves[2]. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the 
people[3]. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of 
broken pieces that were left over[4]. The number of those who ate was about five thousand 
men, besides women and children.

[1] Jesus and his Friends had little.
[2] What little they had, they broke into pieces, so that all may eat.
[3] The people was touched by his Compassion, they did the same - they carried lunches of 
    course.
[4] An overflow of Grace.


Matthew 12:39
He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign[1]! But none will be given 
it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

[1] No miracles for the Public, if they still Lust after Power, Glory and Splendour. Still 
    slaves to MYSTERY, the seductress who misleads the nations, away from Truth and Love.
    
    
Mark 16:18
These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name[1] they will cast out 
demons[2], they will speak with new tongues[3]; they will pick up serpents[4], and if they 
drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them[5]; they will lay hands on the sick, and 
they will recover[6].

[1] If you were to summarize a person's Life, you would use a Name. The Name then is not 
    Jesus but rather Faith for the sake of Love and Truth - the measure of his Life.
    It is not for the sake of credit.
[2] False beliefs, false definitions, false Gods, that are in the Minds of Men. Demons.
[3] Scientific Discovery, Scientific Models, Mathematics, Theories and so on.
[4] Venom creates anti-venom. Science can turn the serpent into a Force for Good.
[5] The cures of Medical Science. 
[6] Doctors curing the Body, Freethinkers curing the Mind.


Mark 10:52
"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you[1]." Immediately he received his sight and 
followed Jesus along the road.

[1] The curse of Adam was to toil the earth forcefully. He and Eve fixed that, they redeemed
    themselves. They raised children capable of bending the elements. The Laws of Physics
    will bend for Love. The price is a Courageous, Honest, Vulnerable Heart that beats for 
    Love.
    
    Jesus does not claim the miracle as his - it was the work of the Author of Law, that 
    all Laws should bow to Love.
    
    
Matthew 10:29
Are not two sparrows[1] sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground 
outside your Father's care.

[1] The man and woman on the street, how could they survive? Their hands are dirty and yet
    they are not sick. They eat and drink poison and no harm comes to them. They do not 
    bathe and yet they are well. The Father cares for them, we should too as well.
    

You cannot command the earth out of Conceit, but only through Faith. Take care of it, for
it is Living Law. Your dominion should be that of a Father and a Mother - Love.
