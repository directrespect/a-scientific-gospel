Mass Effect 3:

  1. The Scientific Salarian:
  
     Genesis 3:1
     Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He 
     said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
     
     The serpent maps to the metaphor of the Dragon in Revelations.
    
  2. The Reaping:
  
     Revelation 14:15
     Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was 
     sitting on the cloud, "Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, 
     for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
