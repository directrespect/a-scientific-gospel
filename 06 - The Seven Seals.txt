The above is unique, but resounds Truth. Who is worthy of opening the seals?

Revelation 5:5
Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah[1], 
the Root of David[2], has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."
[1] Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ 
[2] Jesus pre-existed David, he was the adopted Son of God, and the reason why David was 
    chosen.
Among Warriors and Kings - a Shepherd was chosen. The line worthy of the Lamb. From the 
tribe that is a Lion.
