Emotion:

  A common occurrence in all living creatures - the language of the Spirit.
  
  There are two types of Emotions - one driven by Love and one driven by Selfish

  be dissected - intellectual honesty - using Reason.
  
When Making a Decision:

  After choosing, you will usually sigh. Take note of the nature. Is it a sigh or 
  relief? Or a sigh of disappointment? If the former, then you made the right

  Genesis 2:9
  The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground--trees that were 
  pleasing to the eye[1] and good for food[2]. In the middle of the garden were the 
  tree of life[3] and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil[4].
  
  To your Brother, to your Friends, to Each Other, give:
  [1] Beauty, Art, Creativity
  [2] Food, Nourishment and Nutrition
  [3] Healing and Life
  [4] Knowledge
  
  If you do the above, out of a heart of Faith for Love, then you will sigh - one 
  of relief.
