When Alan Turing came up with the idea of the Machine, he was thinking of a 
metaphorical physical one - he did not envision it as software. Regardless, the 
principles of the Machine was based on recognized patterns in the discipline of 
Computing, therefore, it naturally overflowed to software.

In Alan Turing's metaphor there are three components:
1. An Actor
2. A Machine
3. A Very Very Very long tape. Like srsly long.

In software the above three components can be decomposed into five:
1. An Actor
  1.a Triggering Events
    1.a.1 Events, are triggered based on a valid Set of Rules which can also be 
          called a valid set of Possible States
2. Tape
  2.b A Context representing a Valid State that changes for every Event
  
3. The Machine
  3.a A definition representing the Stateless definition manipulating Context to 
      represent all valid States. The Machine also has state - it is Stateless State.

Therefore, the five components are:
  1. A Singular (Singleton) Stateless Definition
  2. Actors
  3. Events
  4. Context
  5. Set of States

The above definition of #1 bears a striking resemblance to the concept of an absolute 
abstract God (G) or to an absolute abstract Theory of Everything (ToE), i.e.:

The Stateless Definition through which all Contexts pass through to transform from one valid State to another.

Both (G) and (ToE) can be described using one word - Truth or (T).

In Theology, the Gods are actors. The Stateless definition is Love. Already written there. 
God is Love - 1 John. So in life, live for Love then. Concretions are secondary.
