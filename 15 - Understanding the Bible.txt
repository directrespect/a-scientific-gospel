The Measure is the Garden of Eden:

  Genesis 2:9
  The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground--trees that were 
  pleasing to the eye[1] and good for food[2]. In the middle of the garden were the 
  tree of life[3] and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil[4].
  
  [1] Beauty, Art, Creativity
  [2] Food, Nourishment and Nutrition
  [3] Healing and Life
  [4] Knowledge


Everything after that, is just due to the Hardness of Hearts:

   Matthew 19:8
   "Moses permitted you[1] to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it 
   was not this way from the beginning[2]. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, 
   except for marital unfaithfulness[3], and marries another woman, commits adultery.[4].
   
   [1] Divorce was a Law that was not supposed to be. Yet it was written in Scripture. 
       You must read Scripture, always looking back at the original design - the Garden of 
       Eden. Law and Life bound by Love. A Family. Like the Divines.
   
   [2] Emphasis for the above point. Look back to the beginning - the Garden of Eden.
   
   [3] Divorce is permitted when you fall out of Love. Divorce due to greed or other 
       reasons, not out of Love, is invalid therefore. You will simply marry to spite your 
       previous spouse. You will never love your new spouse then.
   
   [4] If the above motivation, just to spite the Love of your Youth. Then you will 
       never feel Love. You steal Love away from the new person you are with. That is what 
       he meant.
