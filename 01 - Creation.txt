Creation:

  Definition: Story of the earth's creation. It might be purely metaphor, or a 
  product of terra-forming.
  
Possible Solutions:
  
  1. Terra-forming:
     
     1.a. Script: 
         
          "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth 
           became[1] formless and empty, darkness[2] was hovering over the surface 
           of the deep[3], and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters[3]."
          
           [1] Normal term used is "was", the NIV footnote has this: "possibly 
               became", for the purposes of the solution, "became" is used.
           [2] Heavy pollution.
           [3] Water, the ice caps have melted away.
          
     1.b. Script:
     
          "And God said, 'Let there be light [1]', and there was light. God saw 
           that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness 
           [2]. God called the light 'day', and the darkness he called 'night.' 
           And there was evening and there was morning  - the first day [3]."
           
           [1] Unknown (?) - Mystery Ingredient Cleaning Earth's Atmosphere 
               (National Geographic)
           [2] Cause of heavy pollution, perhaps composed heavily of carbon.
           [3] Clearing pollution created the possibility of light entering the  
               earth. It enabled the observance of the passage of time.
           
     1.c. Script:
          
          "And God said, 'Let there be an expanse[3] between the waters to 
           separate water[1] from water[2].' So God made the expanse[3] and 
           separated the water[1] under the expanse[3] from the water[2] above it. 
           And it was so. God called the expanse 'sky'[4]. And there was evening, 
           and there was morning - the second day."
           
           [1] Water - singular, the earth was still submerged at this point.
           [2] Water vapour collected in clouds.
           [3] Atmospheric pressure.
           [4] The author could not perceive atmospheric pressure, i.e., saw the 
               sky as a big bowl.
           
     1.d. Script:
          
          "And God said, 'Let the water under the sky be gathered to one[2] 
           place[1], and let dry ground appear.' And it was so. God called the dry 
           ground 'land', and the gathered waters he called 'seas'. And God saw 
           that it was good.
           
           Then God said, 'Let the land produce vegetation[2]... - the third day"
           
           [1] Sea and ice cap formation. 
           [2] The author could not distinguish between the north and south poles 
               - they looked the same. Landmasses of ice was unusual. The author 
               perceived in visions not in HD imagery.
           [3] Genetic engineering for the restoration of vegetation was designed 
               first, it was less challenging.
           
     1.e. Script:
          
          "God said, 'Let there be lights in the sky to separate the day from the 
           night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, 
           and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on 
           earth." And it was so. God made[1] two great lights - the greater 
           light[2] to govern the day and the lesser light[3] to govern the night. 
           He also made the stars. God set them up in the expanse[4] of the sky to 
           give light on the earth and to separate light from darkness[5]. And God 
           saw that it was good... - the fourth day."
           
           [1] Perhaps "shown" to the author or restored them.
           [2] Sun.
           [3] Moon.
           [4] The author does not have knowledge of astronomy. The sky looked 
               like wallpaper.
           [5] The author cannot scientifically define the origins or the nature 
               of light and darkness.
           
     1.f. Script:
          
          "And God said, 'Let the water teem with living creatures[1], and let 
           birds[2] fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky. So God 
           created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving 
           thing[1] with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and 
           every winged bird[2] according to it's kind... - the fifth day."
           
           [1, 2] Design of older species like sea creatures and birds which 
                  descend from dinosaurs are easier. Also, the sea creatures 
                  maintained the temperature of the ocean through movement and the 
                  birds propagated seeds.
           
     1.g Script:
     
         "And God said, 'Let the land produce living creatures according to their 
          kinds: livestock[1], creatures that move along the ground[2], and wild 
          animals[3], each according to it's kind."
          
          [1] Domesticated animals, retaining artificially selected traits.
          [2] Insects and reptiles, though simple are very diverse genetically and 
              are not as neccessary in ecology.
          [3] Non-domesticated animals.
          
         "Then God said, 'Let us[4] make man in our image, in our[4] likeness, and 
          let them rule[5] over..."
         
         "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; 
          male[6] and female[6] he created them."
         
         [4] Emphasis on the plural form.
         [5] Nature of dominion should be like a Father's - Love.
         [6] They were created equal.
         
  2. Metaphor: Will no longer be explained.
  
  
The Garden of Eden:

  Definition: Not the entire earth - but a specific place.

  1. Adam, Script: 
     
     "When the LORD God[1] made the earth and the heavens - and no shrub if the 
      field had yet appeared on the land[2], and no plant of the field had yet 
      appeared on the land[2],...for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth, 
      and there was no man to work the ground, but mist[3] came up from the earth 
      and watered the whole surface of the ground..."
      
      [1] LORD God vs God in the Creation story. LORD God is the Giver of Life. 
          God, the Author of Life spoke, i.e., "God said", the LORD Gode "made".
      [2] Usual term used is "earth", NIV states that "land" may also be used.
      [3] Artificial irrigation, the land[2] might be a green house of sorts.
      
      "...- and the LORD God[1] formed the man[2] from the dust of the ground[3] 
       and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life[4], and the man became a 
       living being."
      
      [1] LORD God, Giver of Life
      [2] Male, Adam.
      [3] Trace DNA from the earth.
      [4] A smile is a universal expression - so is a sigh. Two types - sigh of 
          relief and a sigh of disappointment. When you sigh the second one - 
          reconsider your decision. Emotion is the language of the Holy Spirit.
      
  2. The Garden of Eden, Script:
     
     "Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put 
      the man he had formed. And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of 
      the ground[1]... In the middle of the garden, were the tree of life[2] and 
      of the tree of the knowledge[3] of good and evil."
     
     [1] Not on earth, but on the specific Garden of Eden.
     [2] Tree of life perhaps extended human life-span. The effect is reduced over 
         time.
     [3] Tree of knowledge will give humans the knowledge of the possibility of 
         Conceit. Initially, they were like children - courageous, honest and kind 
         - with boundless curiosity.
         
  3. The First Commandment to Man:
     
     "And the LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work on 
      it and take care of it. 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 
      but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge[1] of good and evil, for 
      when you eat from it you will surely die[2]."
      
      [1] There were two trees, the tree of life can be eaten from freely. The 
          tree of knowledge, not yet. 
      [2] Eating from the tree will cause all the complications and power plays 
          that will arise from the knowledge of the possibility of Conceit - 
          Politics and Power Play. Their identities as children will perish.
          
  4. Eve, Script:
  
     "But for Adam, no suitable helper was found. So the LORD God caused the man 
      to fall into a deep sleep[1]; and while he was sleeping, he took part of the 
      man's side[2] and closed up the place with flesh[3]. Then the LORD God made 
      a woman from the part[2] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to 
      the man."
      
      [1] Like general anaesthesia for surgery.
      [2] Common word used was "rib", NIV states that "part" can also be used. It 
          is easier to create flesh from flesh.


Characters:

   1. God      : Author of Law, The Father : Designed Truth through Words. "Spoke".
   2. LORD God : Giver of Life, The Spirit : Gave the breath of Life to those 
                                             Words. "Made".
   3. The Word : Living Law,    The Son    : And the Word became flesh, the design 
                                             - Truth - is alive, through Love.

   The above looks like a family bound by Love. Unified as one, but not uniform. 
   Free within the absolute boundaries of Love.
   
   The design for Adam and Eve was to become 'one flesh' through Love. The Gods 
   are spirit, there are two types then - Law and Life bound by Love. They are not 
   bound to flesh. They are Spirit. The Author of Law wrote Psychology - so, do 
   not pick and choose which Sciences you believe in.


Conclusion:
 
  In this scenario, the Biblical God and LORD God is similar to the other 
  mythological gods - operating within the boundaries of reality or established 
  law. Like a shepherd or parent, control is necessary but not restrictive - the 
  guidance is driven by Love.
  
  God and LORD God are equals. Words are dead without Life. The living Word is 
  made possible by the Love of the Author of Law and the Giver of Life.
            
  Love - is the point of origin. Always there. Tautology. Singularity. 
  Encompassing all, therefore.
  
  Love is a Law, the Author - the Father did not write. Always there. Always.
  
  Love is above all then. Stateless, invisible, faceless - purely abstract. 
  Perfect. Above the Father, above the Son, above the Spirit. 
  
  "God is Love." - 1 John
  
  It has been there, all along. All this time. That simple.
  
  
Notes on God: 

  Treated usually like a dictator. Always wanting worship and glory and honor. Not 
  so, a son will glorify his father by actions. Like that, not false praise. If a 
  parent sees their children acting out of Love then they are glorified. Sometimes 
  praise is an energetic expression of Love, but should not be forced then.

  Love, singularity, faceless, purely abstract, stateless, is not a Caesar. Divine 
  actors, bow to Love. It was there all along.
  
  "God is Love." - 1 John
  
  The story of the apostle Peter is essential to understand that point. 
  Concretions are secondary. Love purifies all. Not ceremony, not law, but Love. 
  
  Love is not a Caesar.
  
  
Notes on the Trinity:
  
  The four components are necessary for the whole. The whole will not exist 
  without any one of the components:
  
  1. The Father, Author of Law
  2. The Spirit, Giver of Life
  3. The Son, Living Law bound by Love
  4. Motivation, True Love
  5. Methodology, Truth
  
  In the metaphor of the triangle, the first three are the points. The fourth is 
  the line which connects them - True Love. The Components are equals. Remove one, 
  and the whole is incomplete. 
  
  Law is dead without Life and without Creation there is no proof of Love.
  
  Unified but not uniform. Open within the boundaries of True Love. Love is a 
  Tautology:
  
  Truth is Love as Love is True.
  
  It is therefore Root, Singularity, Point of Origin. God is Love.
  

Notes on the Spirit:

  There are two types - Law and Life to be bound by Love - one Law and one Life.
  They are not bound to flesh. Psychology is the work of the Author of Law, do not
  pick and choose which among the Sciences you accept. Have you matched their 
  research then?
  
  Revelation 22:6
  The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God 
  who inspires the prophets[1], sent his angel to show his servants the things that 
  must soon take place."
  
  [1] The Holy Spirit - whose gift is Understanding and Knowledge. The Scientists, 
      then are the prophets.   
      

Notes on this Author:
  
  I am a Theologian of the Scientific Mind - always aiming for Intellectual Honesty.
  The Holy Spirit - Intuition guides me to understanding.
  

Notes on Biblical Authors:

  The Biblical authors should be perceived as human. Limited in knowledge and 
  perceiving images in thought, thus uses of metaphors might not be accurate. 
  Divinely inspired yes, but some would not have been so honest in their writing. 
  Historical context is therefore important. The Biblical authors were more honest 
  than the other writers of theological script. The Greeks for example, 
  politicized heavily, thus their story is confusing.


Notes on Creation:

  Birth and rebirth in the above conforms to the oldest religion - Hinduism.
