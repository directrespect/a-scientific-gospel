Ephesians 2:8
For it is by grace[1] you have been saved, through faith[2]--and this is not from yourselves, 
it is the gift of God

[1] Grace was when the Son willed to live and die for the sake of Truth and Love. A God
    turned purely Man who walked in Courage, Honesty and Vulnerability for the sake of 
    Love and Truth even in the face of Uncertainty.
    
[2] Faith - Courage, Honesty and Vulnerability should be concreted in action for evidence. 
    If your Teacher did that, should not a Student follow?
    
    
Psalm 23:4
Even though I walk through the darkest valley[1], I will fear no evil[2], for you are with 
me; your rod[3] and your staff[4], they comfort me[5].

[1] Uncertainty. We all act on estimate, we should always acknowledge that. Only a Sith 
    deals in absolutes. Uncertainty feels like darkness - at times we feel like we are 
    making choices blindly in the face of the immensity of the Grand Scheme of Things.
    
[2] If you act in Courage, Honest and are willing to be Vulnerable for the sake of Truth 
    and Love then no Evil can be taken against you. You cannot be accused or punished. If 
    you commit an error - it was an honest mistake - you will be willing to correct, 
    because you are of Faith.
    
[3] Rod   : the Father will Rebuke for the sake of Love.

[4] Staff : the Holy Spirit will guide your Heart and give you Understanding - if you are 
            willing to feel emotion - all of it, and dissect your intents. Introspection.
            
[5] Rod and Staff are your Comforts, accept Rebuke and Learn to Reason with Compassion. 
    
    
Matthew 18:15
If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault[1], just between the two of 
you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.[2]

[1] Rebuke personally first.
[2] Then the error will not pass silently.

But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you[3], that every charge may 
be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses.

[3] Rebuke each other as friends. Reason with each other for the sake of Truth and Love.

Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven[4], and whatever
you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven[5].

[4] Acts of Faith will cascade and open doors of Love, closing doors of Slavery.
[5] Acts of Conceit will cascade and close doors of Love, opening doors of Slavery.

You must ask for forgiveness and do reparations. Do not let errors pass silently. Do not 
take the Life and Sacrifice of the Christ lightly. Do not forcibly remove guilt, do 
something about it. Your Teacher did, so should you.

Redemption is not magic, it is rather:
1. Rebuke yourself or others.
2. Gain understanding in order to know how to correct the error.
3. Actually correct the error.

An error corrected is an evidence of Faith, an evidence of Love and Truth, an evidence of 
Compassion. The error is turned to an act of Grace. It is not magic - it requires work. 
Your Teacher did, so should you.


John 2:1-11
On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, and 
Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine was gone, 
Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine.[1]"

"Woman,[2] why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My hour has not yet come."[3]

His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."[4]

They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine.
He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water 
knew [5].

[1] Mary was worried. Mothers will worry about such things, out of Compassion - the desire
    to care for others.
[2] The Greek for Woman does not denote any disrespect.
[3] Jesus was afraid to be exposed. The emotion was Fear, just for himself. It was 
    Self-Preservation above Compassion.
[4] Mary rebuked her Son, she did not care for the reply of Jesus, she ordered the servants 
    to do as Jesus will command. The servants approached and stared at Jesus, waiting for 
    Jesus to say something. Jesus would have looked to his Mother for reassurance. Mary 
    would have smiled and nodded. So Jesus commanded them.
[5] Mary acted for the sake of Compassion, Jesus followed his Mother's command on Faith,
    and his fear of being exposed, did not happen. Instead:
    
What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he 
revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him[6].

[6] Their close circle of Friends, were overjoyed. Including him, he felt relief. 

    His Mother would have said: "I told you so."
    Jesus would have laughed and responded: "Ah, yes Mother. You are always right."
