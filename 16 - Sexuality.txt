Genesis 2:24
That is why a man[1] leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife[2], and they 
become one flesh[3].

[1] Law
[2] Life
[3] United in Love, one is not lesser than the other - they are equals. Different roles,
    but equals. Sex is an act of Love that requires Honesty, Courage and Vulnerability.

Proverbs 5:16
Should your springs[1] overflow in the streets, your streams of water[1] in the public 
squares? Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers. May your fountain1[1] 
be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.

[1] Water is explicitly the metaphor. You should smell sweet to each other.

Proposal on How to Do It:

1. First Stage, Introduction:
   Control: Life
   
   a. Life will torture Law.
   b. Law, you do not have the right to move unless your Life commands it. Close your eyes 
      and open them only when your Life commands. Steal glances. Resist all feelings of 
      pleasure so that you may last.
   c. Life, finish yourself then proceed to the next stage.
   
   Life will practice patience, that is why their Conceit is indirect:
   
   "I hope this happens to..."
   "I hope that happens to..."
   
   So, unleash it here, torture your Law so that your Conceit will cause Pleasure not Pain.
   
   
2. Second Stage, Fair Play:
   Control: Life and Law
   
   a. Life and Law will move, this is a fluid playing field.
   b. Law, still restrain and finish her yourself.
   
   
3. Third Stage, Climax:
   Control: Law
   
   a. Law, if you are able to reach this stage, then you may unleash your Conceit here - 
      violence. Your Life will be ready for it - you will cause Pleasure not Pain.
   b. Law, your violence will be over in a fraction of a second as you hear your Life
      say your name. You will calm down and then make Love, lasting as long as you would 
      like.   
   c. Life, to finish your Law, stare into each other's eyes, when you are about to burst
      command you Law to finish as sweetly as you can.
   
The above will bring you close to Death everytime if you complete the stages.


How to Practice:
  
  5:27-28
  "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you  
   that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in 
   his heart[1].
  
  [1] Do not think of an actual person - that is adultery, you will build up Lust for 
      someone - remember how David and Solomon lost their crown. Rather, fabricate a 
      character - your ideal. Use your imagination.

  1 Corinthians 6:18
  Flee from sexual immorality[1]. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but 
  whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
  
  [1] They meant this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome
  
  Psychology considers masturbation as natural. Do not pick and choose which Sciences you
  adopt, unless you can match their research and disprove it. Or you know, allow people
  to marry younger - 18 and above of course. First love - the Love of your Youth. The reason 
  it is not being implemented is because well, money matters.
  
  Job 1:21
  Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD 
  has taken away[1]; may the name of the LORD be praised.
  
  [1] Early laws should be abandoned if they are outdated - the measure is Love. The reason
      why not all was given was that, they are misunderstood. Look at the state of 
      Religions now, it is Politics.
      
      Imagine if Pasteurization was taught:
      
      "Oh! you have a fever, boil yourself."
      "Let us collectively boil ourselves to be healed."
      "God said all we needed to do was boil things. Sanitizers are evil."
      
      A lot is misunderstood. You think of Sin too much. Don't. Think of Love. Listen to 
      the Sciences then.
      
  
On Homosexuality:
  
  1 Corinthians 6:9-10
  Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be 
  deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men[1] who have 
  sex with men[2].
  
  [1 & 2] Greek words were for dominant and submissive. Sexual slavery through rape as
          described here: 
          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome#Male.E2.80.93male_sex
  
  
  Acts 10:15
  The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God[1] has made 
  clean."
  
  [1] Love - 1 John
  
  Do not pick and choose which Sciences you believe in. Psychology and Sociology find 
  nothing wrong with Homosexuality. If you believe that the Divines are not racist, and 
  that they Love all, then if you look at the cultures of Samoans and Native Americans you 
  will learn that they were called couples of one spirit - they were rare because the 
  population density was low. The Father's design such that orphans might have parents. 
  They have a huge drive to adopt. Is not adoption Love? Two types of Spirits - Law and 
  Life - are not bound by flesh. The Divines do not bow to flesh - but to Love.
  
  
The Father Speaks:

  I am Spirit, do not reduce me to a Penis. I am not a Phallus who is a Caesar. I bow to
  Love, you should do the same.
